Voice Controlled Jenkins Build Application
Problem Statement:
Develop a simple mobile app using apache Cordova that uses Google's speech to text and vice versa feature and hooks up to Jenkins API . So your app will run a pre-defined Jenkins job by voice for example. 


I divided the project into the following modules which are as follows:

i)	Using speech recognizer to convert voice to text.
ii)	Create a job on Jenkins that I could use to build.
iii)	Remote building a job in Jenkins.
iv)	Integrating the application with Jenkins.
v)	Converting text to Voice.

Plugins used: Speech Recognize, Text To Speech.
